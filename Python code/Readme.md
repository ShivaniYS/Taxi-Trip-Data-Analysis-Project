Once the data model is ready, we can start with a few transformations on Python.
Here we start our python transformation by assigning a primary key — ‘trip_id’ to the entire dataset after dropping all duplicates.
Once the dataframe is available we create multiple dataframes from the main dataframe to create dimension tables that we created in the model above.
